# Cryo
A simple programming language. A fun project to learn about programming languages and interpreters.

## Compontents of Cryo

### Lexer
The lexer is responsible for tokenizing the input source code. It reads the source code character by character and generates tokens. The lexer is implemented in `lexer.py`.

### Parser
The parser is responsible for parsing the tokens generated by the lexer. It reads the tokens and generates an abstract syntax tree (AST). The parser is implemented in `parser.py`.

### Interpreter
The interpreter is responsible for interpreting the AST generated by the parser. It reads the AST and executes the code. The interpreter is implemented in `interpreter.py`.
